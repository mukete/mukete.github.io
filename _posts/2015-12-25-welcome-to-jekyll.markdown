Finally he discovered the post where jekyll kept it
and seriously he is tired of using wordpress and all blogging
content whatever systems. he was thinking of statttammatic 
how do they even spell that stuff.

then a thought came to him, "why not try this github pages thingy !"
well here it is...... whatever you see below was auto generated by jekyll...

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
